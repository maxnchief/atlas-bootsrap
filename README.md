Before we begin the inspiration for this site was inspired by this image: 

![Inspiration](images/inspiration.jpg)

This site is created with HTML using bootsrap and a tiny amount of CSS. All of the styling is done in the index file.

The header to grade is just the nav bar at the top of the page

Single item carousel is the quotes beneath that

Free section is sandwiched between the two carousels

As hinted at above, the Multiple Item Carousel is bellow the free section.

The footer is squared away neatly at the bottom of the page


Here is the hosted link for the site: https://maxnchief.github.io/atlas-bootsrap/
